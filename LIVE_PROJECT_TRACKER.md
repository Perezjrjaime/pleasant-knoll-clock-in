# ðŸ“Š Live Project Tracker - Phase 1 Complete!

## What We Built

A **real-time project tracking system** that shows live statistics for active projects, including:
- Hours worked by equipment/role (Labor, Skid Steer, Truck, etc.)
- Materials consumed per project
- Employee participation
- Session counts and date ranges

## Features

### 1. **Projects Tab - Completely Rebuilt**
- Now shows only **active projects** in a clean card grid
- Each project card displays:
  - Project name
  - Project type badge (with gradient styling)
  - Location
  - "View Details" button

### 2. **Live Statistics Modal**
When you click "View Details" on a project, you get:

#### Summary Cards
- **Total Hours**: Aggregated from all approved sessions
- **Sessions**: Count of work sessions
- **Workers**: Number of unique employees
- **Date Range**: First to last work date

#### Hours by Equipment/Role Table
- Sorted from highest to lowest hours
- Shows: Role name, Total hours, % of total time
- Examples: Labor, Skid Steer, Truck, Landscape Foreman, etc.

#### Materials Used Table
- Sorted by quantity
- Shows: Material name, Quantity with unit
- Aggregates all materials added to sessions for this project

#### Hours by Employee Table
- Shows which employees worked on the project
- Total hours per employee
- Sorted by most hours worked

## How It Works

### Data Flow
1. **Load Function** (`loadProjectStats`):
   - Queries all approved `work_sessions` for the selected project
   - Joins with `session_materials` and `materials` tables
   - Aggregates hours by role using `reduce()`
   - Aggregates materials by type
   - Calculates employee totals
   - Gets user names from `user_roles` table

2. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Stats reflect only **approved sessions** (not drafts or pending)
   - Recalculate anytime by clicking "View Details" again
   - Perfect for checking project status mid-work

### UI Highlights
- **Modern Design**: Gradients, shadows, hover effects
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Professional Tables**: Clean data presentation with headers
- **Color Coding**: Blue/purple gradients for headers, green for actions
- **Empty States**: Graceful handling when no data exists yet

## Database Tables Used
- `work_sessions` - Hours worked per session
- `session_materials` - Materials used per session
- `materials` - Material master list with units
- `user_roles` - Employee names and info
- `projects` - Project details

## What's Next - Phase 2

### Project Completion & Final Reports
1. **Mark Complete** button for active projects
2. Generate **final report** with:
   - Complete breakdown (same as live stats)
   - Total project cost estimates
   - Material costs
   - Labor hours totals
3. **Archive completed projects** with preserved stats
4. **History tab integration** to view past project reports
5. **Export/Print** functionality for client invoices

## Testing Guide

### How to Test Right Now:
1. Go to **Projects tab**
2. Make sure you have at least one **active project**
3. Clock in some hours on that project (different roles/equipment)
4. Add some materials to those sessions (from Hours tab, draft sessions)
5. Submit and **approve** those sessions (admin approves in Admin tab)
6. Go back to **Projects tab**
7. Click **"View Details"** on the project
8. See the live statistics! ðŸŽ‰

### Example Scenario:
**Project: "123 Main Street Landscaping"**
- Session 1: 4 hours Labor
- Session 2: 2 hours Skid Steer
- Session 3: 3 hours Labor
- Materials: 5 yards Mulch, 10 lbs Seed

**Stats Should Show:**
- Total Hours: 9h
- Labor: 7h (78%)
- Skid Steer: 2h (22%)
- Materials: 5 yards Mulch, 10 lbs Seed
- Employees: (however many unique workers)

## Code Location

### App.tsx
- **Lines 140-142**: State variables (`selectedProjectForStats`, `projectStats`, `loadingProjectStats`)
- **Lines 1325-1420**: `loadProjectStats()` function
- **Lines 1629-1744**: Projects tab UI (live tracker cards)
- **Lines 2816-2945**: Project Stats Modal component

### index.css
- **Lines 3999-4329**: Complete live project tracker styling
  - Cards, grids, buttons
  - Modal styling
  - Tables with gradients
  - Responsive breakpoints

## Known Unused Variables (Safe to Ignore)
These are warnings from the old project management system we replaced:
- `projectFilter`, `setProjectFilter` - Was for All/Active/Pending filters
- `showEditProject`, `setShowEditProject` - Was for editing projects inline
- `deleteProject`, `updateProject`, `updateProjectStatus` - Old CRUD operations
- `startEditProject` - Old edit handler
- `loadingProjectStats` - Will be used for loading spinners later

We kept these in case you want to add project editing features back later, but the live tracker focuses on **statistics only** for now.

## Summary
