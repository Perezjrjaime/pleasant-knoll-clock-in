# ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2 Complete: Project Completion & Final Reports

## What's New

### 1. **Active/Completed Toggle**
- New toggle buttons at the top of Projects tab
- Switch between "Active Projects" and "Completed" projects
- Shows count for each category
- Green gradient styling for active toggle

### 2. **Mark Complete Feature**
- "Mark Complete" button on each active project card
- Beautiful confirmation modal with checklist:
  - âœ“ Move project to "Completed" status
  - âœ“ Preserve all hours and materials data
  - âœ“ Generate final project report
  - âœ“ Remove from active tracking
- Green gradient "Yes, Mark Complete" button
- Timestamp when project was completed

### 3. **Completed Projects View**
- Toggle to view all completed projects
- Same card layout with completion badge
- "View Final Stats" button (instead of "View Live Stats")
- All statistics preserved from when project was active
- No "Mark Complete" button (already done!)

### 4. **Final Project Reports**
- When you mark a project complete, stats are frozen
- Final report shows:
  - Total hours worked
  - Hours by equipment/role breakdown
  - All materials used
  - Employee participation
  - Date range of work
- Perfect for invoicing or client reports

## Database Changes

### New SQL Migration File: `add-completed-status.sql`

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to enable completed status:

```sql
-- Adds 'completed' to allowed status values
ALTER TABLE projects 
ADD CONSTRAINT projects_status_check 
CHECK (status IN ('active', 'pending', 'completed'));

-- Adds timestamp for when project was completed
ALTER TABLE projects
ADD COLUMN completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- Indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_status ON projects(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_completed_at ON projects(completed_at DESC);
```

## How It Works
