# Timesheet Features Implementation

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Database Persistence
- **Clock-in/out sessions** now automatically save to the `work_sessions` table
- Sessions include: project, location, role, start/end times, duration, and status
- All sessions start with status `'draft'`
- Uses authenticated user ID for proper user association

### 2. Hours Tab Enhancement
- **Combined view**: Shows both in-memory (current day) and database (weekly) sessions
- **Weekly breakdown**: Groups sessions by day with totals
- **Project breakdown**: Shows time spent per project/role combination
- **Real-time updates**: Automatically refreshes every 10 seconds when viewing the Hours tab
- **Today vs. This Week**: Separate cards showing daily and weekly totals

### 3. Timesheet Submission Workflow
- **Status tracking**: Sessions can be `draft`, `submitted`, `approved`, or `rejected`
- **Employee initials**: Required for submission (2-3 characters)
- **Batch submission**: Submits all draft sessions for the current week
- **Week ending date**: Automatically calculated (Saturday of the week)
- **Status badges**: Visual indicators for draft, submitted, approved, and rejected sessions

### 4. User Interface
- **Status summary badges**: Shows count of sessions in each status
- **Submission form**: Clean input for employee initials with submit button
- **Validation**: Ensures initials are 2-3 characters before allowing submission
- **Success/error messages**: Toast notifications for user feedback
- **Completion message**: Shows when all sessions are submitted/approved

## 📋 How It Works

### For Employees:
1. **Clock In/Out**: Use the Clock tab as normal
   - Sessions automatically save to database
   - All new sessions start as "draft"

2. **Review Hours**: Go to Hours tab
   - See all sessions for the current week
   - View daily breakdown and totals
   - Check session statuses

3. **Submit Timesheet**: At end of week
   - Enter your initials (2-3 letters)
   - Click "Submit Timesheet"
   - All draft sessions become "submitted"
   - Wait for admin approval

### For Admins:
- **Pending timesheets** will appear in a future admin interface
- Admins can approve/reject submitted timesheets
- Add notes to rejected timesheets
- Track which employee submitted which timesheet (via initials)

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The `work_sessions` table includes:
- `user_id`: Links to authenticated user
- `project`, `location`, `role`: Work details
- `start_time`, `end_time`, `duration`: Time tracking
- `status`: 'draft', 'submitted', 'approved', 'rejected'
- `week_ending_date`: Saturday of the work week
- `employee_initials`: Who submitted the timesheet
- `submitted_at`: When submitted
- `approved_by`: Admin who approved/rejected
- `approved_at`: When approved/rejected
- `admin_notes`: Feedback from admin

## 🔒 Security

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies:
1. **Users can view their own sessions**
2. **Users can insert their own sessions**
3. **Users can update their own draft sessions**
4. **Admins can view all sessions**
5. **Admins can approve/reject sessions**

## 🚀 Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

### Admin Timesheet Approval Interface
- Add "Timesheets" section to Admin panel
- Show all submitted timesheets grouped by employee
- Approve/reject buttons with notes textarea
- Filter by status and date range
- Export timesheets to CSV/PDF

### Additional Features
- Edit individual sessions (for draft status only)
