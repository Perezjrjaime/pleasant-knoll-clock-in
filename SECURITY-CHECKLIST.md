# 🔒 Security Checklist - Pleasant Knoll Time Clock

## ✅ Current Security Status

### **User Roles Table (user_roles)**
- [x] Created with proper schema
- [ ] **RLS DISABLED** ⚠️ (needs to be re-enabled)
- [ ] Need to run `re-enable-security.sql`

### **Time Entries Table (time_entries)**
- [x] Has RLS policies (assumed from setup)
- [x] Users can only see their own entries
- [x] Secure from unauthorized access

### **Projects Table (projects)**
- [x] Active projects visible to authenticated users
- [x] Proper access controls

## 🛡️ What Needs to Be Done

### **1. Re-enable RLS on user_roles**
**Status:** ⚠️ **URGENT - Currently Disabled**

**Why it matters:**
- Right now, ANY authenticated user can see and modify ALL user roles
- Without RLS, a regular user could promote themselves to admin
- The fetch API workaround works fine WITH or WITHOUT RLS

**Action Required:**
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run the script: `re-enable-security.sql`
3. Test that:
   - You can still sign in as admin
   - Admin panel still works
   - You can approve users

## 🔐 Security Policies Being Added

### **user_roles Table Policies:**

1. **"Users can view their own role"**
   - Users can see their own role status
   - Prevents seeing other users' roles (unless admin)

2. **"Authenticated users can view all roles"**
   - Needed for admin panel to show user list
   - Read-only access for regular users
   - Admins can still manage in UI

3. **"Admins can update roles"**
   - Only users with role='admin' can change roles
   - Prevents self-promotion attacks

4. **"Admins can insert roles"**
   - Only admins can manually create role entries
   - Auto-creation via trigger still works (uses service_role)

## 🚨 Current Vulnerabilities (Without RLS)

### **What Could Go Wrong:**
1. ❌ Regular user could query database directly
2. ❌ Could change their own role to 'admin'
3. ❌ Could approve themselves
4. ❌ Could see all user emails/names without permission

### **What's Protected:**
✅ App-level checks still work (your fetch API approach)
✅ Admin panel only visible to role='admin' users
✅ Can't change roles from the UI unless admin

**BUT** - a tech-savvy user could bypass UI and hit the database directly!

---

## ✅ After Re-enabling RLS

### **What Will Be Secure:**
✅ Database-level security (not just app-level)
✅ Users can't promote themselves via direct DB access
✅ Admins-only role updates enforced at DB level
✅ Industry-standard security posture

### **What Will Still Work:**
✅ Your fetch API workaround (doesn't rely on RLS)
✅ Admin panel user management
✅ Role-based access control in app
✅ Auto-role creation for new signups

## 📋 How to Re-enable Security

### **Step-by-Step:**

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in left sidebar

3. **Run the Security Script**
   - Copy contents of `re-enable-security.sql`
   - Paste into SQL Editor
   - Click "RUN"

4. **Verify Policies Created**
   - Should see 4 new policies created
   - Check output shows policies are active

5. **Test Your App**
   - Sign in as admin
   - Check admin panel still works
   - Try approving a user
   - Everything should work the same!

## 🎯 Why This Is Important

**Current State:** Your app is secure at the **application level** but not at the **database level**.

**With RLS:** Defense in depth - even if someone bypasses your app, the database won't let them do harm.

**Best Practice:** Always enable RLS on tables containing user data or permissions.

## ⚡ Quick Summary

**Do This Now:**
1. Run `re-enable-security.sql` in Supabase
2. Test that app still works
3. Sleep better knowing it's secure! 😴

**Total Time:** 2 minutes  
**Risk if you don't:** Medium (users could theoretically hack their roles)  
**Benefit:** Proper database-level security 🔒
